# dotfiles

Since I got tired of recreating my preferences every time I change to a new machine.
This isn't fully automated like some examples you'll find on the Internet, but it's good enough for now.

## Symlinks

You'll need to use symlinks to point your machine to these files. An example could be
```
ln -nfs ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```
